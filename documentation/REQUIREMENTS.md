## Phased Requirements Plan: Centralized Field & Climate Configuration

### Overview
This plan details the phased implementation of:
- Centralized field configuration (all field names, aliases, validation in one place)
- Centralized climate configuration (all climate parameters in one place, default Houston, TX, USA)
- Refactoring all code to use these configurations

Each phase preserves all existing functionality and ensures a smooth transition with minimal risk.

---

### **Phase 1: Centralized Field Configuration Foundation**

**Requirements:**
- Create `field_config.py` to define:
  - All database field names (matching current Google Sheet columns)
  - User-friendly aliases for each field
  - Field categories (basic info, care, media, metadata)
  - Field validation and mapping functions
- Update documentation to reference `field_config.py` as the single source of truth
- Add tests for field mapping and validation

**Success Criteria:**
- All field names and aliases are defined in one place
- Field validation functions pass all tests
- No changes to existing database structure or functionality

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Do not remove or change any field in the database
- Add configuration in parallel to existing code (no breakage)

---

### **Phase 2: Centralized Climate Configuration Foundation**

**Requirements:**
- Create `climate_config.py` to define:
  - All climate parameters (zone, temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil, seasons, etc.)
  - Default location: Houston, TX, USA
  - Functions to retrieve climate context for prompts and logic
  - Support for future user override (but default must remain Houston)
- Update documentation to reference `climate_config.py` as the single source of truth for climate
- Add tests for climate context retrieval

**Success Criteria:**
- All climate parameters are defined in one place
- Default climate context is Houston, TX, USA
- All tests for climate context pass
- No changes to existing prompt logic or user experience

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Add configuration in parallel to existing code (no breakage)
- Do not remove or change any climate logic until all tests pass

---

### **Phase 3: Code Refactor to Use Centralized Configurations**

**Requirements:**
- Refactor all code to use `field_config.py` for all field name, alias, and validation logic
- Refactor all code to use `climate_config.py` for all climate context and prompt logic
- Remove all hardcoded field names and climate parameters from code
- Update all tests to use new configuration modules
- Update documentation to reflect new usage patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- No hardcoded field names or climate parameters remain in code
- All tests pass with new configuration modules
- No regression in existing features or user experience

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Refactor incrementally, testing after each change
- Maintain full test coverage throughout
- Roll back changes if any regression is detected

---

### **Phase 4: Final Validation and Documentation**

**Requirements:**
- Perform comprehensive testing of all features (manual and automated)
- Update all user and developer documentation
- Announce new configuration system to all stakeholders

**Success Criteria:**
- All features work as before, with configuration now centralized
- Documentation is up to date
- Stakeholders are informed and trained if needed

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Maintain ability to revert to previous version if critical issues are found
- Provide migration guide if needed
