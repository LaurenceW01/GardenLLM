# GardenLLM Enhanced Natural Language Processing Implementation Plan

## Document Information
- **Created**: December 2024
- **Purpose**: Implement enhanced natural language processing for garden database mode
- **Goal**: Allow users to ask general gardening questions that may reference plants in their database
- **Status**: Planning Phase

## Overview

This plan implements enhanced natural language processing for garden database mode, allowing users to ask general gardening questions that may reference plants in their database. The implementation will be done in phases, ensuring full functionality is maintained throughout.

### Current Problem
- Users can only ask specific plant queries that match exact database entries
- General gardening questions fail because system treats entire query as plant name search
- No distinction between database-only queries and general knowledge queries

### Solution
- **Query Classification**: Determine if query needs database-only or AI processing
- **Plant Reference Extraction**: Use AI to identify plants mentioned in natural language
- **Conditional Processing**: Use database for location/photo/list queries, AI for care/diagnosis/advice
- **Enhanced Context**: Provide AI with plant database data and Houston climate context

## Phase 1: AI-Powered Query Analysis
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Goal**: Add AI-powered query analysis that extracts plant names AND classifies query type in one call

### New Components
1. **Query Analyzer Function**
   - Add `analyze_query()` function that uses AI to:
     - Extract plant names referenced in the query
     - Classify the query type (LOCATION, PHOTO, LIST, CARE, DIAGNOSIS, ADVICE, GENERAL)
   - Return both plant references and query classification in one AI call

2. **Query Type Constants**
   - Add constants for query types: `LOCATION`, `PHOTO`, `LIST`, `CARE`, `DIAGNOSIS`, `ADVICE`, `GENERAL`

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Add logging for query analysis decisions
   - Track which path each query takes

### Implementation Details
- Create new file: `query_analyzer.py`
- Add AI prompt template for combined plant extraction + classification
- Integrate with existing `chat_response.py` but don't change current flow yet
- Add unit tests for analysis function

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test query analysis accuracy with sample queries
- [ ] Test plant extraction accuracy
