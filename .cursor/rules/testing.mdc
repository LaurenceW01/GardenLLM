description: Always test with unit and functional tests at the end of an implementation phase
alwaysApply: false

When implementing app changes we do so as part of a plan which will be in an associated .md file.
The implementation plan will be in broken into phases.
At the end of writing the code to implement a phase, a set of tests will be written and run to prove the new code works.
The test scripts will be kept in the tests folder.
The test output will also be written to a log file of the same name as the test program which will be kept in the tests-results folder.
